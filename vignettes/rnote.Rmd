rnote is a simple package that allows you to make notes and recall them from any project.

### Make a note:
```{r}
rnote::jotdown(note = "this is a note", topics = c("test_topic1", "test_topic2"))
```

### Recall notes to console:
```{r}
rnote::checknotes(topic = "test_topic1", current_project = FALSE, n = 10)
```

### Initialise project notes:
Save your notes to a directory in your project folder, as well as your central archive.

```{r eval = FALSE}
rnote::init_project_notes()
```
