rnote is a simple package that allows you to make notes and recall them from any project by saving them to the package directory.

### Make a note:
```{r}
rnote::jotdown(note = "this is a note", topics = c("test_topic1", "test_topic2"))
```

### Recall notes to console:
```{r}
rnote::checknotes(topic = "test_topic1", current_project = FALSE, n = 10)
```

### Back up notes to new location:
```{r eval = FALSE}
rnote::backup.notes(file = "notes.csv", current_project = FALSE)
```
